### Background task

Fontmon will continue to run in the background when the window is closed, so it won't bother you after you installed your fonts.

### Quit and you are done

When you quit fontmon all loaded fonts will automatically be uninstalled. This makes it perfect for when you work on projects and you already know which fonts to use, you only need them for as long as you work on your project.

## Get fontmon

Fontmon is currently only available for Windows, this is due to the fact that windows won't allow you to install fonts if you are not an administrator, fontmon however, won't need any administrator rights.

Mac and Linux support should be coming soon, or if it takes you too long you can contribute yourself.

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/AndyBitz/fontmon/releases)
